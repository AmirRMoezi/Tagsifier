# Tagsifier
Tagsifier is a Python tool designed to classify web pages into categories based on their HTML tags and structure. By analyzing the DOM elements, Tagsifier groups pages with similar layouts, making it easier to identify templates, detect page types, or cluster websites with alike structures. This can be useful for web scraping, site audits, SEO analysis, or automated website categorization.
